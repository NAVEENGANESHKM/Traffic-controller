# Traffic-controller
- In this mini project, i've designed a traffic controller for a 4 way traffic lane with routes T1,T2,S1,S2.

- The state transition for a traffic signal occurs in time intervals 7secs,5secs,2secs,3secs respectively.

- the 4 states change in particular delays, in which each route's traffic lights go into three modes(Red,Yellow,Green).
